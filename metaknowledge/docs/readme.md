Hi! If you're reading this it means you've been tasked with completing what I started to convert the metaknowledge docs to read the docs. (Or, you are me in a few weeks returning to work on this.) This should help you understand what I've done, what's left to be done, and how to do it.

If you have any questions, message me on mattermost or email me at rewood34@mgmail.com (will be more responsive here).

I've been working from <a href="https://github.com/rachel94/metaknowledge">this cloned repo of metaknowledge</a>.: https://github.com/rachel94/metaknowledge. If you need access to this, let me know. The scripts used to create the docs are in metaknowledge/metaknowledge/docs.
